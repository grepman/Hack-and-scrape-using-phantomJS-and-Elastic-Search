# How I Scraped/Hacked https://www.theatlas.com/ 

A friend of mine asked me to hack all the data from https://www.theatlas.com/ , which is online data sharing and creation platform.

So I figured out a way which i am sharing with you about how to Hack/Scrape data from any REACT Website since the ATLAS is a React Website (Even Facebook)

## Requirements
  - Node JS
  - Phantom JS
  - Elastic Search

> You can refer to the above Code which i shared
